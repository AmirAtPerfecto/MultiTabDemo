# MultiTabDemo
Testing of multiple tabs in desktop web
Some websites have developed technology to become aware of the page(s) being open in multiple tabs and act accordingly. One example is when you have a retail site, and the user transacts with their shopping cart in multiple tabs. One may want to keep those tabs in sync at some level.

The demo opens 3 tabs: Google, Amazon and Barnes and Nobles. In each of them separately it does a search, and lastly it rotates through all 3.

In IntelliJ you will need to define:

PERFECTO_CLOUD: xyz.perfectomobile.com <br/>
